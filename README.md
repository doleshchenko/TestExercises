# TestExercises
The test exercise consists of two solutions: : "**Refactoring**" and "**Layers**". Please use them to perform next tasks:

## Refactoring:
1. Add a unit test(s) for TakePassengers method. We don't need 100% coverage. Just cover the payment part - lines 43 - 64.
2. Refactor method TakePassengers of Taxi class. You can use any technic you want. The code is not ideal in terms of styling and readability. It would be a great plus if you could improve it.
## Layers:
1. The solution consists of several projects. They are empty. We don't care about the  code. The name of the each project explains the layer to which it belongs. Please add references between the projects.
 
All these tasks should not take much time - no more than two hours. There is no restrictions in tools. You can use any software.
